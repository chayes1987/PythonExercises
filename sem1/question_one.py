Q.1 Write a Python program that reads in 9 assignment marks from a user and displays the average of the 9 assignments.
    The assignments are marked out of 10 and the overall result should be a percentage. A sample of the program running:

    Enter mark for assignment 1: 4
    Enter mark for assignment 2: 7
    â€¦
    Enter mark for assignment 9: 6

    Overall result = 54.17%

    (25 marks)
